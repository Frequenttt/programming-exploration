1- I am curious about this project because I am interested in creating websites. It feels like this is the only thing I'm good at, so I want to make use of it (or try to, at least).
2- So far, I have learned how to use Bootstrap 5, I have improved on my Javascript coding and learned more about HTML and CSS. With boostrap, I learned how to create working buttons, pop-ups, linking between different websites and making profile tables.

3- Some problems I've faced were the code not working due to misspelling, not putting semi colon at the end of every piece of code while using CSS, bootstrap code messing the HTML code.
