1- I am curious about this project because I am interested in creating websites. It feels like this is the only thing I'm good at, so I want to make use of it (or try to, at least).

2- So far, I have learned how to use Bootstrap 5, I have improved on my Javascript coding and learned more about HTML and CSS. With boostrap, I learned how to create working buttons, pop-ups, linking between different websites and making profile tables.

3- Some problems I've faced were the code not working due to misspelling, not putting semi colon at the end of every piece of code while using CSS, bootstrap code messing the HTML code.

4- The next steps I need to take are at least I should design my website with some text and make it about something, because I haven't even decided what to write yet.

5- The code is mine because I decorated the design myself with CSS, used various bootstrap functions, and HTML. I have included different popovers, a profile card, hyperlinks and buttons.

6-Using data-bs, I made popovers and by using basic CSS commands I decorated the webapp, while making sure these all work with Javascript and HTML.

7- I learned how to use Bootstrap 5, JavaScript and I have improved on HTML and CSS. With these, I have learned how to create buttons, popovers, adding hyperlinks, web design, profile cards, tables, adding links on tables, many new commands I can use in the future.
